      description: "**Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Mark Rylance, BFG is the hopscotchy adaptation of Roald Dahl\u2019s book about a young orphan named Sophie and the dream-blowing Big Friendly Giant. Since it was released in 1982 the BFG has sold more than 37 million copies worldwide and the Herne Hill Free Film Festival is delumptiously happy to be bringing this most recent film adaptation to Rosendale Primary School on 28 April at 7:30pm for the 2017 festival\u2019s opening film!**\n\nMark Rylance, the voice of the BFG, a local resident and one of the greatest stage actors of his generation will be appearing for a Q&A after the screening. How whoopsy whiffling is that!\n\nAfter discovering a mysterious cloaked figure blowing something through a trumpet-shaped object into a nearby bedroom window, the orphan Sophie is taken to Giant Land by the BFG. There she gets to learn about frobscottle, whizpopping and snozcumbers but also the lives of the BFG\u2019s less than friendly neighbours and their less than savoury activities. With Sophie\u2019s help the BFG manages to convince the Queen of England of the need to imprison the unfriendly giants and, with the British Army and Royal Air Force behind her (it would hardly be believable otherwise!), the Fleshlumpeater, Bloodbottler, Gizzardgulper and Childchewer all find themselves suspended from helicopters rotoring their way to an ucky-mucky end in a subterranean prison. \n\nCome to Rosendale Primary School on 28 April at 7:30pm to celebrate the opening of the 2017 Herne Hill Free Film Festival and for the chance to meet the BFG himself, Mark Rylance, who will be answering questions from the audience after the film! We expect this to be a popular event so get there early to grab a seat\u2026 and you\u2019ll be glad to know that while refreshments will be available frobscottle and snozcumbers will only be featuring on the screen!\n",

From this film descended Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, Escape From LA, Gattaca and Batman's Gotham City and the laboratory of its evil genius created the visual look of mad scientists for decades to come. The Herne Hill Free Film Festival cannot control its excitement to be screening Fritz Lang\u2019s classic, accompanied by Gottfried Huppertz\u2019s original score, at All Saints\u2019 Church \u2013 a truly spectacular local venue \u2013 on 29 April at 7:30pm. Aaarrrgghhh. So excited!**\n\nMetropolis employed vast sets, 25,000 extras and astonishing special effects decades ahead of its time to create a world of two parts, each ignorant of the other. Both are run by the businessman-dictator Joh Fredersen: the great city of Metropolis, with its stadiums, skyscrapers and expressways in the sky is starkly contrasted with the subterranean workers\u2019 city, where the clock face shows 10 hours to cram another day into the work week. Joh\u2019s son Freder is in the Pleasure Gardens one day when Maria, a woman from the subterranean city, brings a group of workers' children to the surface. Struck by Maria\u2019s beauty and astonished to learn of the life led by the workers, Freder seeks out the demented genius Rotwang, who knows the secrets of the lower world.\n\nWe know you\u2019ve heard of Metropolis \u2013 hey, it\u2019s one of the most influential films ever made \u2013 but we also know you\u2019ve probably never had the opportunity to see it in a setting as spectacular as All Saints Church. Lang filmed for nearly a year, driven by obsession, often cruel to his colleagues, a perfectionist madman. All we\u2019re asking for is one evening. It\u2019d be rude not to come along on 29 April at 7:30pm!\n",

We are grateful to The United Liberation Movement of West Papua who will attend the screening and participate in a Q&A after the evening\u2019s films. All donations from the event will go to their campaign and we thank you in advance for your generous support.**\n\n\\# Punks for West Papua (46 mins)\n\nCreated by Ash Brennan and narrated by Basia Bonkowski, this short film tells the story of the Australian punk scene\u2019s fight against Indonesian oppression of West Papua, in which Indonesia receives support from the Australian government. Jody Bartolo of Sydney punk band Diggers with Attitude turns a fundraising event into an Australia wide benefit involving over 50 bands in 7 cities around the country, making Punks For West Papua the biggest, and no doubt, loudest punk rock showcase in Australia\u2019s history. The documentary has been picking up awards around the world, including the Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards and IndieFest San Diego. For more information on the punks\u2019 fight please visit www.punks4westpapua.com.\n\n\\# Marikana: Precious Metal (26 mins)\n\nA year after the Marikana massacre, where South African police opened fire and killed 34 striking miners, the women of the Wonderkop settlement decide to stage a musical play of the event.  Led by the charismatic and inspirational Primrose they struggle against forgetting and struggle for justice, in the face of ongoing violence between rival unions and the mining company Lonmin which is focused on business as usual.\n",

Join us at The Lido Caf\xE9, one of our favourite venues, on 1 May at 8pm for Ciro Guerra\u2019s dreamlike journey to the Amazon.**\n\nIn one sense Embrace of the Serpent is a drama about the effect of European colonialisation on the Amazon but in another it is an attempt by Colombian director Ciro Guerra to build a bridge between western and Amazonian storytelling. Shot on location in the Colombian jungle over 8 weeks the film tells two stories of European explorers searching for a fictional flower, set more than 30 years apart. Based on the journals of two real-life explorers, the film weaves these stories around a shamen called Karamakate who is the last surviving member of the Cohiuano tribe. An old and a young Karamakate puts the Europeans\u2019 materialism and vanity into perspective but in this 2hr visual indulgence these characters also offer an indigenous viewpoint to the terror and violence of the colonial era.\n\nWith breath-taking cinematography and a soundtrack that blends indigenous song with contemporary instrumentation this is a film you can\u2019t miss. The Guardian called it an \u201Cextraordinary, hypnotic work\u201D and we were certainly extraordinarily hypnotised when we saw it during its too-narrow UK release in 2016. If you want to see for yourself, and we recommend that you do, join us at The Lido Caf\xE9 on 1 May at 8pm!\n",

In particular I wanted to know why my old lady wasn\u2019t, at her tender age, even pedalo\u2019ing across the lake in Dulwich Park let alone rowing the Atlantic Ocean. If you want to go through the same personal crisis as me, come down to The Florence on 3 May at 8pm and be blown over by a short film about a long journey, and four incredible women from Yorkshire.**\n\n**We are particularly excited about this one as the filmmaker, Simon Tucker, will be coming to the screening to answer questions after the film\u2026 And if that\u2019s not enough there will also be a number of inspiring short films on the night (which we\u2019re keeping under wraps to preserve their inspirationalness\u2026 but we assure you they\u2019re worth the trip on their own)!**\n\nIn December 2015, 27 crews paddled out from La Gomera, the start line of the Talisker Whiskey Atlantic Challenge and attempted to row over 3,000 miles to Antigua. Among the crews were some of the toughest endurance athletes in the world. And four mums from Yorkshire. With absolutely no endurance or adventure experience to speak of.\n\nFour Mums in a Boat tells the tale of how four women from Yorkshire became the oldest all-female crew to row across any ocean, despite meeting a hurricane and losing power, water and their steering along the way. Screened as part of the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour we\u2019re glad that it\u2019s making a stop in SE24 on 3 May, so come on down to The Florence at 8pm to be overOARed (we know, our wit knows no bounds) and inspired by four people\u2019s mums.

Based on a short-film the Herne Hill Free Film Festival screened in 2016 (called Emotional Fusebox, we loved it!) the film tackles weighty themes with a light and often humorous touch. Although we originally scheduled this screening for one of Herne Hill\u2019s finest sheds, we decided to upgrade the venue at the last minute so come on down to The Prince Regent on 4 May at 8pm for shed-less night with this oddball Britflick. The film\u2019s producer will be coming down for the screening and a Q&A so make sure you\u2019re on your best behaviour!**\n\nAnna is approaching 30, living like a hermit in her mum's garden shed and wondering why the suffragettes ever bothered. She spends her days making videos using her thumbs as actors - thumbs that bicker about things like whether Yogi Bear is a moral or existential nihilist. But Anna doesn't show these videos to anyone and no one knows what they are for. A week before her birthday her Mum serves her an ultimatum - she needs to move out of the shed, get a haircut that doesn't put her gender in question and stop dressing like a homeless teenager. Naturally, Anna tells her Mum to \"back the f-off\". However, when her school friend comes to visit, Anna's self-imposed isolation becomes impossible to maintain. Soon she is entangled with a troubled eight year old boy obsessed with Westerns, and the local estate agent whose awkward interpersonal skills continually undermine his attempts to seduce her.\n\nThe Herne Hill Free Film Festival will be bringing Adult Life Skills out of the shed and into The Prince Regent on 4 May at 8pm for a night we\u2019ve been looking forward to ever since we saw Emotional Fusebox, the short-film the feature length film is based on, back in 2016. This is another screening that draws on the depth of local talent in South London and we\u2019re lucky to have the film\u2019s producer joining us on the night for the screening and a Q&A at the end. Given how excited we were for this night back in 2016, we can\u2019t even begin describe how we\u2019re feeling about it now\u2026\n",
