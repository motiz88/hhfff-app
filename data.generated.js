Join us at The Lido Caf\xE9, one of our favourite venues, on 1 May at 8pm for Ciro Guerra\u2019s dreamlike journey to the Amazon.**\n\nIn one sense Embrace of the Serpent is a drama about the effect of European colonialisation on the Amazon but in another it is an attempt by Colombian director Ciro Guerra to build a bridge between western and Amazonian storytelling. Shot on location in the Colombian jungle over 8 weeks the film tells two stories of European explorers searching for a fictional flower, set more than 30 years apart. Based on the journals of two real-life explorers, the film weaves these stories around a shaman called Karamakate who is the last surviving member of the Cohiuano tribe. An old and a young Karamakate puts the Europeans\u2019 materialism and vanity into perspective but in this 2hr visual indulgence these characters also offer an indigenous viewpoint to the terror and violence of the colonial era.\n\nWith breath-taking cinematography and a soundtrack that blends indigenous song with contemporary instrumentation this is a film you can\u2019t miss. The Guardian called it an \u201Cextraordinary, hypnotic work\u201D and we were certainly extraordinarily hypnotised when we saw it during its too-narrow UK release in 2016. If you want to see for yourself, and we recommend that you do, join us at The Lido Caf\xE9 on 1 May at 8pm!\n",

      descriptionPlain: "A winner at Cannes and a nominee for the 2015 Best Foreign Language Oscar (Colombia\u2019s first ever Oscar nomination), Embrace of the Serpent tells two tales \u2013 separated by more than 30 years \u2013 of European scientists searching for the yakruna, a mystical and fictional flower. Join us at The Lido Caf\xE9, one of our favourite venues, on 1 May at 8pm for Ciro Guerra\u2019s dreamlike journey to the Amazon.\n\nIn one sense Embrace of the Serpent is a drama about the effect of European colonialisation on the Amazon but in another it is an attempt by Colombian director Ciro Guerra to build a bridge between western and Amazonian storytelling. Shot on location in the Colombian jungle over 8 weeks the film tells two stories of European explorers searching for a fictional flower, set more than 30 years apart. Based on the journals of two real-life explorers, the film weaves these stories around a shaman called Karamakate who is the last surviving member of the Cohiuano tribe. An old and a young Karamakate puts the Europeans\u2019 materialism and vanity into perspective but in this 2hr visual indulgence these characters also offer an indigenous viewpoint to the terror and violence of the colonial era.\n\nWith breath-taking cinematography and a soundtrack that blends indigenous song with contemporary instrumentation this is a film you can\u2019t miss. The Guardian called it an \u201Cextraordinary, hypnotic work\u201D and we were certainly extraordinarily hypnotised when we saw it during its too-narrow UK release in 2016. If you want to see for yourself, and we recommend that you do, join us at The Lido Caf\xE9 on 1 May at 8pm!"

      description: "**Despite receiving a luke-warm reception from the critics on its release in 1959, Imitation of Life is now widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of 1950s cinema which since 2015 has been preserved in the United States\u2019 Library of Congress as a \u201Cculturally, historically and aesthetically significant\u201D film. Douglas Sirk\u2019s last film from Hollywood deals with issues of race, class, gender and identity \u2013 themes which remain relevant to all of us today \u2013 and you can watch it as part of the Herne Hill Free Film Festival at 7:30pm on 5 May at Holy Trinity Church. After the screening we will be holding a discussion of the important themes raised in this film, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in! **\n\nMade shortly after the birth of the US Civil Rights movement (and only 4 years after the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955) Imitation of Life follows the relationship between two single mothers, both widows, one white and one black, and the challenges they and their similarly aged daughters face as they venture out into the world around them in 1950s America. \n\nLora Meredith is an aspiring actress who takes in Annie Johnston as her housekeeper after a chance meeting at a beach when Lora\u2019s daughter goes missing. Not just the nanny to Lora\u2019s daughter and her live-in housekeeper, Annie also becomes a personal intimate and a professional colleague as Lora\u2019s career takes off. At the same time Annie has to deal with Sarah Jane, her own daughter, who is struggling with her African-American identity.\n\nAlthough derided as a \u201Csoap opera\u201D on its release in 1959 the film was a success at the box office and its critical reception has improved with age. Dealing with broken homes and complex class, race and gender relationships, Imitation of Life is regarded as the jewel in Douglas Sirk\u2019s directing crown. As his last Hollywood film it certainly marks an appropriate end to his celebrated career.\n\nJoin us at Holy Trinity Church on 5 May at 7:30pm for this masterpiece of 1950s cinema. We will be holding a discussion of the key themes raised in the film after the screening, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in!\n",

      descriptionPlain: "Despite receiving a luke-warm reception from the critics on its release in 1959, Imitation of Life is now widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of 1950s cinema which since 2015 has been preserved in the United States\u2019 Library of Congress as a \u201Cculturally, historically and aesthetically significant\u201D film. Douglas Sirk\u2019s last film from Hollywood deals with issues of race, class, gender and identity \u2013 themes which remain relevant to all of us today \u2013 and you can watch it as part of the Herne Hill Free Film Festival at 7:30pm on 5 May at Holy Trinity Church. After the screening we will be holding a discussion of the important themes raised in this film, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in! \n\nMade shortly after the birth of the US Civil Rights movement (and only 4 years after the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955) Imitation of Life follows the relationship between two single mothers, both widows, one white and one black, and the challenges they and their similarly aged daughters face as they venture out into the world around them in 1950s America. \n\nLora Meredith is an aspiring actress who takes in Annie Johnston as her housekeeper after a chance meeting at a beach when Lora\u2019s daughter goes missing. Not just the nanny to Lora\u2019s daughter and her live-in housekeeper, Annie also becomes a personal intimate and a professional colleague as Lora\u2019s career takes off. At the same time Annie has to deal with Sarah Jane, her own daughter, who is struggling with her African-American identity.\n\nAlthough derided as a \u201Csoap opera\u201D on its release in 1959 the film was a success at the box office and its critical reception has improved with age. Dealing with broken homes and complex class, race and gender relationships, Imitation of Life is regarded as the jewel in Douglas Sirk\u2019s directing crown. As his last Hollywood film it certainly marks an appropriate end to his celebrated career.\n\nJoin us at Holy Trinity Church on 5 May at 7:30pm for this masterpiece of 1950s cinema. We will be holding a discussion of the key themes raised in the film after the screening, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in!"

Join us at The Prince Regent on 14 May at 8pm for one of our favourite documentaries of 2016\u2026 it\u2019s one we\u2019re certain you won\u2019t want to miss!**\n\nA boxing match in Brooklyn; life in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina; the daily routine of a Nigerian midwife; a bustling Sunday market in Herne Hill (ok, we jest); an intimate family moment at home: these scenes and others are woven by Kirsten Johnson into Cameraperson, a tapestry of footage collected over her twenty-five-year career. Through a series of episodic contrasts, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality and crafted narrative. A hybrid work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, Cameraperson is a moving glimpse into one filmmaker's personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world.\n\nEver since we saw this one late last year we\u2019ve wanted to bring it to the people of Herne Hill and our 2017 festival is the first chance for us to do so. If you like documentaries as much as we do you\u2019re going to love this one, so come on down to The Prince Regent on 14 May at 8pm for this unique and absorbing film.\n",

      descriptionPlain: "Cinematographer Kirsten Johnson has shot movies including Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), Kirby Dick\u2019s The Invisible War (2012) and Laura Poitras\u2019s Citizenfour (2014), and in Cameraperson she has created an audacious and experimental collage-film, pulling together a mosaic of fragments from the 20 years that she has shot for other people, and also personal material about her own family. Join us at The Prince Regent on 14 May at 8pm for one of our favourite documentaries of 2016\u2026 it\u2019s one we\u2019re certain you won\u2019t want to miss!\n\nA boxing match in Brooklyn; life in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina; the daily routine of a Nigerian midwife; a bustling Sunday market in Herne Hill (ok, we jest); an intimate family moment at home: these scenes and others are woven by Kirsten Johnson into Cameraperson, a tapestry of footage collected over her twenty-five-year career. Through a series of episodic contrasts, Johnson explores the relationships between image makers and their subjects, the tension between the objectivity and intervention of the camera, and the complex interaction of unfiltered reality and crafted narrative. A hybrid work that combines documentary, autobiography, and ethical inquiry, Cameraperson is a moving glimpse into one filmmaker's personal journey and a thoughtful examination of what it means to train a camera on the world.\n\nEver since we saw this one late last year we\u2019ve wanted to bring it to the people of Herne Hill and our 2017 festival is the first chance for us to do so. If you like documentaries as much as we do you\u2019re going to love this one, so come on down to The Prince Regent on 14 May at 8pm for this unique and absorbing film."

      description: "**Winner of the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival, Fire at Sea (or Fuocoammare) is a documentary shot on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa during the European migrant crisis, setting the migrants' dangerous Mediterranean crossing against a background of the ordinary life of the islanders. If it was meaningful enough for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to carry 27 copies of the film to a session of the European Council, one for each member state of the European Union, it should pique your interest enough to make your come to The Half Moon on 15 May at 8pm for this mid-week documentary screening.**\n\nIn his 2016 documentary, director Gianfranco Rosi contrasts the lives of the thousands of migrants landing on the shores of Lampedusa with the everyday existence of the locals. The tragic epicentre of the migrant crisis, 400,000 migrants have arrived on Lampedusa over the past 20 years and many thousands more have died making the journey in unsafe vessels refuelled in choppy seas from diesel jerry cans mid-journey. Using mainly fixed camera positions and no narrative voiceover, the film juxtaposes scenes switching between the migrants\u2019 daily, desperate landfall, and the everyday existence of one Lampedusa family and one young boy in particular. Samuel\u2019s uncle is a fisherman, he does his best at school, he slurps his pasta at dinner, and he likes cutting branches that will make handles for his slingshot. His Lampedusa, his home, is different to the one experienced by the migrants on the island, part holding tank and part cemetery. \n\nThe migrant crisis may have left our front pages but it has most certainly not gone away, and this beautifully tragic documentary is a reminder of the struggle that hundreds of thousands of people embark on every year, risking their lives and families for the chance of a better life. Join us at The Half Moon on 15 May at 8pm for this masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis. And don\u2019t forget. \n",

Screening at Brockwell Park at 9pm on 20 May the night will be a sing-a-long spectacular to make the most of a legendary soundtrack of camp-classics, from ABBA to CeCe Peniston and Gloria Gaynor. Get in your shower now and get practicing\u2026 there\u2019s still time to perfect your \u201CI Will Survive\u201D!**\n\nIn The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert the usually menacing British actor Terence Stamp does a complete turnaround as Bernadette, an aging transsexual who tours the backwaters of Australia with her stage partners, Mitzi (played by Hugo Weaving) and Adam/Felicia (played by Guy Pearce). Their act, well-known in Sydney, involves wearing lots of makeup and gowns and lip-synching to records, but Bernadette is getting a bit tired of it all and is also haunted by the bizarre death of an old loved one. Nevertheless, when Mitzi and Felicia get an offer to perform in the remote town of Alice Springs at a casino, Bernadette decides to tag along. The threesome ventures into the outback with Priscilla, a lavender-colored school bus that doubles as dressing room and home on the road. Along the way, the act encounters any number of strange characters, as well as incidents of homophobia, while Bernadette becomes increasingly concerned about the path her life has taken.\n\nJoin us at Brockwell Park on 20 May at 9pm for the sing-a-long version of this camp classic. Dress up or dress down, we don\u2019t mind, but make sure you bring your best singing voice and get ready to shake your groove thing!\n",

We caught this one on its release in the cinema but it\u2019s really a film that works best in the right setting, and outdoors, in Herne Hill (we think everything\u2019s better in Herne Hill), on a late May evening and with a Sterling prize winner as the backdrop is a pretty good effort we thought!\n",

The film follows 10-year old Yula, living in Europe's largest junkyard on the outskirts of Moscow, for a period of 14 years as she plays innocent childhood games, finds love for the first time and, as a grown woman, has the realisation that her future lies outside of the Svalka\u2019s walls. We know you\u2019re going to enjoy this one, but we also know you\u2019re not going to get another chance to it again any time soon. So make the most of this opportunity and come down to The Lido Caf\xE9 on 29 May at 8pm. You won\u2019t be disappointed.**\n\nSituated 13 miles from the Kremlin, just on the outskirts of Putin's big showcase of a city, the Svalka is a huge mountain of trash, 17 stories high and stretching for over two miles. Although life can be grim and dismal for the Svalka's inhabitants, it also brings out the best in people; they generously share their vodka and last breadcrumbs with each other and open up their ramshackle sheds to shelter those who need it. And despite the misery that life here has to offer, people strive for normality. Yula \u2013 the 10-year old focus of the film \u2013 dreams of escaping the Svalka and, for a period of 14 years Something Better to Come, follows Yula's life. In 2000 the film\u2019s director was granted intimate access Yula and her family, and over more than a decade she builds a solid relationship of trust with those that she's filming. With year after year passing and it appears that nothing changes for Yula, however the film\u2019s epilogue \u2013 shot six years after the main bulk of the running time \u2013 gives cause for optimism.\n\nThe Herne Hill Free Film Festival is lucky to have the chance to show this documentary from Oscar nominated Polish director, cinematographer and producer Hannah Polak.
