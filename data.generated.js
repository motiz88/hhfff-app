Join us at The Lido Caf\xE9, one of our favourite venues, on 1 May at 8pm for Ciro Guerra\u2019s dreamlike journey to the Amazon.**\n\nIn one sense Embrace of the Serpent is a drama about the effect of European colonialisation on the Amazon but in another it is an attempt by Colombian director Ciro Guerra to build a bridge between western and Amazonian storytelling. Shot on location in the Colombian jungle over 8 weeks the film tells two stories of European explorers searching for a fictional flower, set more than 30 years apart. Based on the journals of two real-life explorers, the film weaves these stories around a shamen called Karamakate who is the last surviving member of the Cohiuano tribe. An old and a young Karamakate puts the Europeans\u2019 materialism and vanity into perspective but in this 2hr visual indulgence these characters also offer an indigenous viewpoint to the terror and violence of the colonial era.\n\nWith breath-taking cinematography and a soundtrack that blends indigenous song with contemporary instrumentation this is a film you can\u2019t miss.

Dealing with broken homes and complex class, race and gender relationships, Imitation of Life is regarded as the jewel in Douglas Sirk\u2019s directing crown. As his last Hollywood film it certainly marks an appropriate end to his celebrated career.\n\nJoin us at Holy Trinity Church on 5 May at 7:30pm for this masterpiece of 1950s cinema.

After the screening we will be holding a discussion of the important themes raised in this film, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in! \n\nMade shortly after the birth of the US Civil Rights movement (and only 4 years after the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955) Imitation of Life follows the relationship between two single mothers, both widows, one white and one black, and the challenges they and their similarly aged daughters face as they venture out into the world around them in 1950s America. \n\nLora Meredith is an aspiring actress who takes in Annie Johnston as her housekeeper after a chance meeting at a beach when Lora\u2019s daughter goes missing. Not just the nanny to Lora\u2019s daughter and her live-in housekeeper, Annie also becomes a personal intimate and a professional colleague as Lora\u2019s career takes off. At the same time Annie has to deal with Sarah Jane, her own daughter, who is struggling with her African-American identity.\n\nAlthough derided as a \u201Csoap opera\u201D on its release in 1959 the film was a success at the box office and its critical reception has improved with age. Dealing with broken homes and complex class, race and gender relationships, Imitation of Life is regarded as the jewel in Douglas Sirk\u2019s directing crown. As his last Hollywood film it certainly marks an appropriate end to his celebrated career.\n\nJoin us at Holy Trinity Church on 5 May at 7:30pm for this masterpiece of 1950s cinema. We will be holding a discussion of the key themes raised in the film after the screening, and we would love it if as many people as possible came along and joined in!\n"

      description: "**Winner of the Golden Bear at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival, Fire at Sea (or Fuocoammare) is a documentary shot on the Sicilian island of Lampedusa during the\xA0European migrant crisis, setting the migrants' dangerous Mediterranean crossing against a background of the ordinary life of the islanders. If it was meaningful enough for Italian Prime Minister\xA0Matteo Renzi to carry 27 copies of the film to a session of the\xA0European Council, one for each member state of the\xA0European Union, it should pique your interest enough to make your come to The Half Moon on 15 May at 8pm for this mid-week documentary screening.**\n\nIn his 2016 documentary, director Gianfranco Rosi contrasts the lives of the thousands of migrants landing on the shores of Lampedusa with the everyday existence of the locals. The tragic epicentre of the migrant crisis, 400,000 migrants have arrived on Lampedusa over the past 20 years and many thousands more have died making the journey in unsafe vessels refuelled in choppy seas from diesel jerry cans mid-journey. Using mainly fixed camera positions and no narrative voiceover, the film juxtaposes scenes switching between the migrants\u2019 daily, desperate landfall, and the everyday existence of one Lampedusa family and one young boy in particular. Samuel\u2019s uncle is a fisherman, he does his best at school, he slurps his pasta at dinner, and he likes cutting branches that will make handles for his slingshot.\xA0His Lampedusa, his home, is different to the one experienced by the migrants on the island, part holding tank and part cemetery. \n\nThe migrant crisis may have left our front pages but it has most certainly not gone away, and this beautifully tragic documentary is a reminder of the struggle that hundreds of thousands of people embark on every year, risking their lives and families for the chance of a better life. Join us at The Half Moon on 15 May at 8pm for this masterly and moving look at the migrant crisis. And don\u2019t forget. \n",
